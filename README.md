Hulusi (aka the Gourd Flute/Cucurbit Flute) is a traditional Chinese instrument. I recorded myself playing it to create 2 soundfonts; one with the traditional 8 pitches and one with the traditional 8 + computer generated pitches for a full 5 octave chromatic scale. This is free for anyone to use, so feel free to download if you want to try it out or use it in music making.
